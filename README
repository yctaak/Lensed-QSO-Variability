This folder contains a python file that reads lensed QSO catalogs (OM10 and Yue22),
and processes them to produce forecasts of the number of lensed QSOs that exhibit sufficient variability. 

0_read.py: sanity check
1_run.py: conducts calculations & creates figures
The base code gives results for LSST, but can be altered to provide forecasts for other surveys. 
Also, the thresholds for subsamples of systems with bright and large variability can be altered as well.
